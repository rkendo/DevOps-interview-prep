Throughout my career, I have accumulated over 6 years of experience in DevOps, focusing significantly on the implementation and management of CI/CD pipelines. My journey began at Sapient, where I developed and maintained CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Groovy DSL. This involved automating the build, test, and deployment processes for multiple projects, ensuring rapid and reliable software delivery.
At Altimetrik, I further honed my skills by integrating Jenkins with Git, Docker, and Kubernetes to create robust CI/CD workflows. I was responsible for managing daily builds and releases, troubleshooting build failures, and ensuring that the automated processes ran smoothly. This hands-on experience has equipped me with a deep understanding of the entire CI/CD lifecycle.
In my most recent role at GlobalLogic, I took on the responsibility of orchestrating end-to-end CI/CD pipelines using AWS and Terraform. I wrote Terraform scripts to set up infrastructure and integrated GitHub Actions for continuous integration, which significantly improved deployment efficiency. My ability to create and maintain these pipelines has been a key factor in my success in delivering high-quality software products.
